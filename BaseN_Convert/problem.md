With the work of the physicist Schr√∂dinger, you have discovered a new way to store data on a hard drive by adding states called "undefined". Thanks to you, the amount of data to be stored is reduced. The N states are :
0 : low state
1 : very low undefined state
...
N-2 : very high undefined state
N-1 : high state


In order to be able to use your new system, you must convert the input number from a base 10 to your new system (also called base N). Numbers greater than 10 on bases greater than 10 will be represented by the letters a to z and A to Z, with a = 10, z = 35, A=36 and Z=61. The case of the letters is important,

The exercise consists of conversion from a base 10 number to a base N.


Input
Line 1: N the destination base
Line 2: Number in decimal system to convert in base N

Output
One line of the number in base N
Constraints
Number in decimal system < 1 000 000
N<62


Example
Input
50
10
Output
a
